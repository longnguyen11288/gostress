gostress - A clients/server websocket
=====================================

This program tests websocket capability.

How it work:
------------
  A connected client send a command to the server, wait for a response, 
when the client get a response from server it wait a time between 1 and 3600
second to do the same process. This couple of programs was tested with more 
than 500 000 connections without problem.

Please report any suggest, bug or feature request :-)

      $> go run pool.go server.go
